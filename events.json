Results of this market will be decided by the official Steam player count (\"Peak Today\") available at https://store.steampowered.com/stats/. \n\nIf Lost Ark is #1-5 or tied for any of those spots, the market will resolve \"Yes\", and otherwise \"No.\" \n\nIn the event the resolution source is not available on April 15, 2022 at 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible source will be chosen. If no other credible sources are available, the source will be checked every 24 hours until April 22, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, when the market will resolve 50-50.\n\n\nThe games listed at the resolution source will be ranked from highest to lowest based on the amounts in the \"Peak Today\" column. In the case of ties, the market will use standard competition ranking (\"1224\" ranking),  where each game's ranking number is 1 plus the number of games ranked above it.\n","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","outcomePrices":"[\"0.9999993704218810278230827151838988\", \"0.0000006295781189721769172848161011607476\"]","volume":"9266.403901","active":true,"marketType":"normal","closed":true,"marketMakerAddress":"0xB7C6cD4879f4FF08C7A3D362fB99CD8EbeA5E9AD","updatedBy":15,"createdAt":"2022-03-30T23:33:16.961Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T00:33:04.671029Z","closedTime":"2022-04-16 07:48:04+00","wideFormat":false,"new":false,"sentDiscord":false,"mailchimpTag":"4010504","featured":false,"submitted_by":"0x400567bc06000e36db66f725f16d08f4C579D1Fe","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-lost-ark-be-in-the-top-5-most-played-games-on-steam-on-april-15-2022.png?1649812377554","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1649812377554","archived":false,"resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"groupItemTitle":"","questionID":"0x5deee4c89a40468d54caee55c4bc3df3cbcf9e763074a277f9085be49745d745","umaEndDate":"April 25, 2022","enableOrderBook":false,"umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","volumeNum":9266.4,"liquidityNum":150,"endDateIso":"2022-04-15","startDateIso":"2022-04-04","umaEndDateIso":"2022-04-25","hasReviewedDates":true,"readyForCron":true,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"clobTokenIds":"[\"90320291785671756208825228059451212609259551307148421048773274754678011165898\", \"15557113895767324162329036450281865274861759993212826884533767436390225252537\"]","fpmmLive":true,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false}],"tags":[{"id":"100215","label":"All","slug":"all","forceShow":false,"updatedAt":"2024-05-30T15:49:47.004061Z"}],"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:40:02.908Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false},{"id":"2908","ticker":"2022-nba-playoffs-round-2-who-will-win-celtics-vs-bucks","slug":"2022-nba-playoffs-round-2-who-will-win-celtics-vs-bucks","title":"2022 NBA Playoffs, Round 2: Who will win Celtics vs. Bucks?","description":"The 2022 NBA playoffs is the main postseason tournament of the 2021–22 season.
